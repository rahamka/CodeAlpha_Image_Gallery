Image Gallery Project

This project is a simple and responsive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal is to display images in a clean layout with basic navigation controls, focusing on layout structure, styling, and user interaction.

The gallery features a centered image display with left and right arrow controls that allow users to navigate between images. A fixed header at the top shows the project title and an Upload button, designed as a UI element for future image upload functionality.

The layout uses Flexbox to keep everything aligned and centered across different screen sizes. Images are styled with rounded corners and scale down on smaller devices using a media query, making the gallery mobile-friendly.
